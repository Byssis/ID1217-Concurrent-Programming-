Find common values in T different array. Each array is represented
by a process. Solution implements a circular pipeline. Process 0 (root process) start by sending one value at time
to process 1. Process 1 checks if received value is also in process 1 array.
If true it will send the received to the next process.

When process 0 is done sending all values it signals that all values are
sent to process 1 and process 1 will signal process 2 and so on.

If process 0 receives any value, it means it is a common value for all
arrays. It will then send it to the next process.

Process 0 will send to 1 and receive from T-1
Process T-1 will send to 0 and receive from T-2
Process I will send to I+1 and receive from I-1
